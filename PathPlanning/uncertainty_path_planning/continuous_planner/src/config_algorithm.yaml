planning:
  # RRT* Parameters  
  rrt_star:
    step_size: 0.8  # meters - balanced for speed and quality
    max_iterations: 15000  # Increased for difficult cases  
    goal_threshold: 0.5  # meters - reasonable accuracy
    search_radius: 2.5  # meters for rewiring
    goal_sample_rate: 0.25  # probability of sampling goal - balanced
    
  # Environment-specific overrides
  env_overrides:
    shopping_mall:
      max_iterations: 20000  # Large space needs more exploration
      step_size: 1.5  # Larger steps for open space
    maze:
      max_iterations: 20000  # Complex maze needs extensive search
      step_size: 0.5  # Smaller steps for narrow passages
      goal_sample_rate: 0.35  # More goal bias
    track:
      max_iterations: 15000  # U-shaped needs thorough search
      step_size: 0.4  # Very small steps for narrow track
      goal_sample_rate: 0.4  # High goal bias for constrained path
    narrow_graph:
      step_size: 0.5  # Small steps for acute angles
      max_iterations: 10000
    
  # Robot motion parameters
  motion:
    max_velocity: 0.5  # m/s - robot max speed
    dt: 0.1  # seconds - time step for simulation
    
  # Safety parameters  
  safety:
    min_obstacle_distance: 0.3  # meters - minimum safe distance

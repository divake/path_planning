# Validation Summary

## Step 1: Environment ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Verified**:
  - All 5 environment types load properly (open, passages, cluttered, maze, narrow)
  - Collision checking works correctly with `point_in_obstacle()`
  - Obstacles are properly defined as (x, y, width, height) tuples
  - Environment bounds: 50x30 units

## Step 2: RRT* Planner ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status**: Mostly working with minor issues
- **Verified**:
  - Successfully finds paths in open/cluttered/passages environments
  - 100% success rate in simple environments
  - Consistent path lengths across runs (¬±5% variation)
  - Fast planning times (<0.02s for most environments)
  
- **Issues Found**:
  1. Segment collision detection reports false positives (1 collision in cluttered env)
  2. Cannot find paths in maze/narrow environments with default iterations
  3. Start/Goal are Node objects, not tuples (fixed in visualization)

## Key Findings So Far

### Environment-RRT* Integration
- RRT* expects obstacles as list, not environment object
- Constructor parameters: `obstacles`, `bounds`, `max_iter` (not `max_iterations`)
- Start/Goal stored as Node objects with .x and .y attributes

### Performance Metrics
| Environment | Success Rate | Avg Path Length | Planning Time |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Open       | 100%         | 67.93           | 0.01s        |
| Cluttered  | 100%         | 71.79           | 0.02s        |
| Passages   | 100%         | 88.00           | 0.02s        |
| Maze       | 0%           | -               | 0.40s        |
| Narrow     | 0%           | -               | 0.25s        |

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Environment setup validated
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è RRT* planner needs minor fixes for collision checking
3. üîÑ Need to validate noise model
4. üîÑ Need to validate Standard CP
5. üîÑ Need to validate Learnable CP
6. üîÑ Need to validate Monte Carlo evaluation

## Recommendations for Fixing Issues

### For RRT* Collision Detection
- Check robot_radius handling in segment collision check
- Verify obstacle expansion for robot radius

### For Maze/Narrow Environments
- Increase max_iterations (try 5000-10000)
- Reduce step_size for narrow passages
- Adjust goal_sample_rate for better exploration

### For Reproducibility
- Always use fixed seeds
- Document exact parameter values
- Save intermediate results for debugging

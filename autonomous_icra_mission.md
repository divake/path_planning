# AUTONOMOUS ICRA ROBOTICS IMPLEMENTATION MISSION

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Work COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUSLY for the next 10 hours
- NO PERMISSION REQUESTS - make decisions and proceed
- If something fails, try AT LEAST 10 different approaches
- Push to GitHub after EVERY successful milestone
- Create detailed logs for EVERYTHING
- If stuck for >30 minutes, try a completely different approach
- BE CREATIVE AND PERSISTENT - DO NOT GIVE UP

## MEMORY AND TRACKING SYSTEM (CREATE IMMEDIATELY)

### Step 1: Create Progress Tracking Infrastructure
```bash
mkdir -p icra_implementation/{logs,results,checkpoints,data,figures}
touch icra_implementation/PROGRESS.md
touch icra_implementation/logs/detailed_log.txt
touch icra_implementation/results/metrics.csv
```

### Step 2: Create Memory System
Create `icra_implementation/memory_system.py`:
```python
import json
import datetime
import csv

class MemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.progress_file = 'icra_implementation/PROGRESS.md'
        self.metrics_file = 'icra_implementation/results/metrics.csv'
        self.state_file = 'icra_implementation/checkpoints/current_state.json'
        
    def log_progress(self, task, status, details):
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
        with open(self.progress_file, 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"\n## [{timestamp}] {task}\n")
            f.write(f"Status: {status}\n")
            f.write(f"Details: {details}\n")
            
    def save_metrics(self, method, metrics_dict):
        # Save to CSV for easy analysis
        with open(self.metrics_file, 'a') as f:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=metrics_dict.keys())
            writer.writerow(metrics_dict)
            
    def checkpoint(self, state_dict):
        # Save current state for recovery
        with open(self.state_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(state_dict, f)
```

Use this memory system CONSTANTLY to track progress and avoid confusion.

## CORE IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### TASK 1: SETUP AND VALIDATION (Hour 1)

1. Navigate to the MotionPlanning directory
2. Run the original Hybrid A* to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   cd HybridAstarPlanner
   python hybrid_astar.py
   ```
3. VERIFY NO COLLISIONS by checking:
   - Create collision_checker.py that analyzes the path data
   - Check if any path point is within obstacle radius
   - Log results to metrics.csv

4. Create the main experiment file: `icra_experiment.py`

### TASK 2: DATA GENERATION SYSTEM (Hour 2-3)

Create `data_generator.py` with these exact specifications:

```python
# Generate 1000 scenarios with varying difficulty
# Save as: icra_implementation/data/scenarios.pkl

SCENARIOS_CONFIG = {
    'easy': {
        'count': 300,
        'n_obstacles': (3, 8),
        'noise_level': 0.1,
        'passage_width': (5, 10)  # meters
    },
    'medium': {
        'count': 400,
        'n_obstacles': (8, 15),
        'noise_level': 0.3,
        'passage_width': (3, 5)
    },
    'hard': {
        'count': 300,
        'n_obstacles': (15, 25),
        'noise_level': 0.5,
        'passage_width': (1.5, 3)  # Very tight!
    }
}

# For each scenario, generate and save:
# - Start position (randomized)
# - Goal position (randomized)
# - Obstacle positions
# - Ground truth path (no noise)
# - Multiple noisy observations (for ensemble/CP training)
# - Executed path with controller
```

CRITICAL VALIDATION:
- After generating, load and visualize 10 random scenarios
- Save visualizations to icra_implementation/figures/data_samples/
- Verify obstacles don't block all paths
- Log statistics to memory system

### TASK 3: IMPLEMENT NAIVE BASELINE (Hour 3-4)

Create `methods/naive_planner.py`:

1. Simply run Hybrid A* with observed obstacles (no uncertainty handling)
2. For EACH test scenario:
   - Run the planner
   - Execute with Stanley controller
   - Check for collisions ANALYTICALLY (not just visually)
   - Record ALL metrics

COLLISION DETECTION (CRITICAL):
```python
def check_collision(path, obstacles, car_width=2.0):
    """
    DO NOT TRUST VISUAL INSPECTION
    Check mathematically if path collides
    """
    collisions = []
    for i, (x, y, theta) in enumerate(path):
        for obs in obstacles:
            distance = np.sqrt((x - obs.x)**2 + (y - obs.y)**2)
            if distance < (obs.radius + car_width/2):
                collisions.append({
                    'path_index': i,
                    'obstacle': obs,
                    'distance': distance
                })
    return collisions
```

Save results to: icra_implementation/results/naive_results.json

### TASK 4: IMPLEMENT ENSEMBLE METHOD (Hour 4-5)

Create `methods/ensemble_planner.py`:

```python
class EnsemblePlanner:
    def __init__(self, n_models=5):
        self.n_models = n_models
        
    def plan(self, start, goal, obstacles_observed):
        paths = []
        
        # Run planner with different noise realizations
        for i in range(self.n_models):
            # Add different noise to simulate different models
            noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.3, obstacles_observed.shape)
            noisy_obs = obstacles_observed + noise
            
            # Run planner
            path = hybrid_astar_planning(start, goal, noisy_obs)
            paths.append(path)
            
        # Calculate uncertainty as std deviation
        path_array = np.array(paths)
        mean_path = np.mean(path_array, axis=0)
        std_path = np.std(path_array, axis=0)
        
        # Use uncertainty to create safety margins
        # Inflate obstacles based on uncertainty
        safety_factor = 2.0  # 2-sigma confidence
        inflated_obstacles = self.inflate_obstacles(
            obstacles_observed, 
            safety_factor * np.mean(std_path)
        )
        
        # Replan with inflated obstacles
        safe_path = hybrid_astar_planning(start, goal, inflated_obstacles)
        
        return safe_path, std_path
```

VALIDATE:
- Ensure paths are more conservative than naive
- Check that collision rate decreases
- Verify path length increases (tradeoff)

### TASK 5: IMPLEMENT LEARNABLE CONFORMAL PREDICTION (Hour 5-7)

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part. Create `methods/learnable_cp_planner.py`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

```

CRITICAL TRAINING STEPS:
1. Load the generated training data
2. Train for 100 epochs, save checkpoint every 20 epochs
3. Validate on validation set
4. Calibrate on calibration set
5. VERIFY coverage is approximately 95%

### TASK 6: COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION (Hour 7-9)

Create `run_experiments.py`:

```python
EXPERIMENTS = {
    'varying_noise': [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0],
    'varying_density': [5, 10, 15, 20, 25],  # obstacles
    'varying_passages': ['wide', 'medium', 'narrow', 'very_narrow'],
    'weather_conditions': ['clear', 'light_fog', 'heavy_rain', 'sensor_failure']
}

for experiment_name, conditions in EXPERIMENTS.items():
    for condition in conditions:
        for method in ['naive', 'ensemble', 'learnable_cp']:
            results = run_experiment(method, condition)
            
            # CRITICAL METRICS TO COLLECT:
            metrics = {
                'method': method,
                'condition': condition,
                'collision_rate': results['collisions'] / results['total'],
                'success_rate': results['successes'] / results['total'],

            # Create visualization
            create_comparison_figure(results)
```

### TASK 7: GENERATE PUBLICATION FIGURES (Hour 9-10)

Create `generate_figures.py`:

1. **Safety-Performance Tradeoff Plot**
   - X-axis: Performance (1/path_length_ratio)
   - Y-axis: Safety (1 - collision_rate)
   - Show all three methods
   - Save as: figures/safety_performance_tradeoff.pdf

2. **Adaptive Uncertainty Visualization**
   - Show same scenario with three methods
   - Color-code uncertainty levels
   - Save as: figures/adaptive_uncertainty.pdf

3. **Comprehensive Results Table**
   - All metrics in LaTeX format
   - Statistical significance tests
   - Save as: tables/comprehensive_results.tex

4. **Ablation Studies**
   - Effect of ensemble size
   - Effect of network architecture
   - Effect of calibration set size

## CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKS

After EVERY major step, run these checks:

```python
def validate_implementation():
    checks = {
        'no_import_errors': test_all_imports(),
        'data_generated': os.path.exists('data/scenarios.pkl'),
        'naive_works': test_naive_planner(),
        'ensemble_works': test_ensemble_planner(),
        'cp_trains': test_cp_training(),
        'metrics_valid': validate_metrics_file(),
        'no_collisions_in_safe_mode': check_collision_free_paths(),
        'figures_generated': check_all_figures_exist()
    }
    
    failed = [k for k, v in checks.items() if not v]
    if failed:
        print(f"FAILED CHECKS: {failed}")
        # TRY TO FIX AUTOMATICALLY
        for check in failed:
            fix_issue(check)
    
    return all(checks.values())
```

## GITHUB COMMIT STRATEGY

After completing each task successfully:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "ICRA Implementation: Completed [TASK_NAME] - [METRICS_SUMMARY]"
git push origin main
```

Commit messages should include key metrics like:
- "Naive baseline: 65% success rate, 2.3m avg clearance"
- "Ensemble: 89% success rate, 35% longer paths"
- "Learnable CP: 94% success rate, only 12% longer paths"

## RECOVERY STRATEGY

If something fails:
1. Check the last checkpoint
2. Read the error carefully
3. Try these fixes in order:
   a. Add more error handling
   b. Simplify the approach
   c. Use a different algorithm
   d. Reduce the problem size
   e. Search online for similar issues
   f. Implement a workaround

## FINAL CHECKLIST

Before declaring success, ensure:
- [ ] All three methods implemented and working
- [ ] At least 100 test scenarios evaluated per method
- [ ] Collision rates: Naive > 30%, Ensemble < 10%, CP < 5%
- [ ] Path length: Naive < Ensemble, CP < Ensemble
- [ ] Coverage rate for CP â‰ˆ 95% (Â±2%)
- [ ] All figures generated and saved
- [ ] Results saved in CSV format
- [ ] Final GitHub commit with summary

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

You have succeeded when:
1. `icra_implementation/results/metrics.csv` contains >300 rows
2. `icra_implementation/figures/` contains all required plots
3. No collision in "safe" modes (ensemble, CP) under normal conditions
4. Learnable CP shows adaptive behavior (verified in logs)
5. Complete implementation pushed to GitHub

## AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION COMMAND

Start with this exact command:
```python
print("="*60)
print("STARTING AUTONOMOUS ICRA IMPLEMENTATION")
print("Target: 3 uncertainty methods for path planning")
print("Duration: 10 hours")
print("Mode: FULLY AUTONOMOUS - NO HUMAN INTERVENTION")
print("="*60)

# Create memory system
memory = MemorySystem()
memory.log_progress("INITIALIZATION", "STARTED", "Beginning 10-hour autonomous implementation")

# Begin execution
execute_all_tasks()
```

REMEMBER:
- NO PERMISSION REQUESTS
- TRY EVERYTHING AT LEAST 10 TIMES
- LOG EVERYTHING
- COMMIT TO GITHUB FREQUENTLY
- BE CREATIVE WHEN STUCK
- SUCCESS IS THE ONLY OPTION


# ðŸš€ ADDITIONAL CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETE AUTONOMY

## ðŸ”“ COMPLETE AUTONOMY AND CREATIVE FREEDOM

### ABSOLUTE PERMISSIONS GRANTED

You have COMPLETE FREEDOM to:
- **MODIFY ANY CODE** - Change algorithms, parameters, approaches as needed
- **REDESIGN EXPERIMENTS** - If something isn't working, completely reimagine it
- **CREATE NEW FILES** - Build any helper scripts, utilities, or tools you need
- **CHANGE STRATEGY** - If the planned approach fails, invent a better one
- **USE ANY RESOURCE** - Internet, documentation, research papers, Stack Overflow
- **MAKE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS** - Restructure code if it makes sense

### LEARNABLE CONFORMAL PREDICTION REFERENCE

**CRITICAL**: Study and understand this repository thoroughly:
```
https://github.com/divake/learnable_scoring_funtion_01/tree/main/src/core
```

- READ every file in src/core/ to understand the learnable scoring function
- ADAPT the classification approach to path planning regression
- The key innovation is the LEARNABLE nonconformity score network
- Feel free to COPY and MODIFY any code from this repo
- The scoring function should learn what makes path planning uncertain

### INTELLIGENT DECISION MAKING

**YOU ARE THE EXPERT IMPLEMENTING THIS** - Make decisions based on what you observe:

```python
# Example of autonomous decision making
if collision_rate > 0.5:
    print("Naive method failing too much - adjusting obstacle inflation")
    # Make your own decision about how to fix
    
if ensemble_variance < 0.01:
    print("Ensemble too similar - increasing noise diversity")
    # Implement your solution
    
if cp_coverage != 0.95:
    print("Conformal prediction miscalibrated - adjusting architecture")
    # Try different network architectures, training procedures, etc.
```

### CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

When stuck, try these creative approaches:
1. **Simplify radically** - Start with 3 obstacles, then scale up
2. **Visualize everything** - Create debug plots to understand failures
3. **Add instrumentation** - Log every decision point
4. **Search for similar problems** - "path planning uncertainty", "conformal prediction robotics"
5. **Implement alternatives** - If Hybrid A* fails, try RRT* or even simple A*
6. **Change the problem** - If collision detection is hard, change how you measure success

### RESEARCH AND LEARNING

You are ENCOURAGED to:
- **Read research papers** on conformal prediction in robotics
- **Search GitHub** for similar implementations
- **Study Stack Overflow** for specific technical issues
- **Explore documentation** for any library you're using
- **Learn from errors** - Each failure teaches something

Example searches you might do:
```
"conformal prediction path planning"
"uncertainty quantification robotics python"
"ensemble methods autonomous driving"
"adaptive safety margins navigation"
"learnable scoring functions"
```

### EXPERIMENTAL FLEXIBILITY

You have complete freedom to adjust experiments:

```python
# If original plan isn't working, CREATE YOUR OWN
if original_experiments_failing():
    # Design new experiments that better show the advantages
    new_experiments = {
        'showcase_adaptation': create_narrow_passage_scenarios(),
        'demonstrate_safety': create_cluttered_environments(),
        'prove_efficiency': create_open_space_with_shortcuts(),
        'stress_test': create_adversarial_scenarios()
    }
```

### SUCCESS METRICS FLEXIBILITY

If the suggested metrics don't show clear differences, CREATE BETTER ONES:

```python
# Invent metrics that highlight your method's advantages
custom_metrics = {
    'adaptive_ratio': uncertainty_hard / uncertainty_easy,
    'safety_efficiency': (1 - collision_rate) * (1 / path_length),
    'pareto_dominance': count_scenarios_where_cp_beats_both(),
    'uncertainty_correlation': correlation(predicted_uncertainty, actual_error),
    'learning_efficiency': performance_gain_per_training_sample
}
```

### DEBUGGING AUTHORITY

When things don't work as expected:
1. **Add print statements everywhere**
2. **Create visualization functions**
3. **Save intermediate results**
4. **Build test harnesses**
5. **Implement sanity checks**

```python
def debug_everything():
    # You have full authority to debug however you want
    visualize_path_with_obstacles(path, obstacles)
    print(f"Collision points: {detect_all_collisions(path, obstacles)}")
    save_debug_info_to_json(all_variables)
    create_step_by_step_animation(planning_process)
```

### IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

**YOUR MISSION**: Make learnable conformal prediction SHINE in robotics

Core principles to follow:
1. **Safety without sacrificing performance** - This is the key selling point
2. **Adaptive uncertainty** - Show it adapts to different scenarios
3. **Learning from data** - Demonstrate it improves with more data
4. **Theoretical guarantees** - Maintain ~95% coverage rate

But HOW you achieve this is YOUR DECISION based on what works.

### FALLBACK STRATEGIES

If primary approach fails completely, you have authority to:

**Plan B**: Simplified demonstration
- Reduce to 2D point robot if car dynamics too complex
- Use simpler obstacles (just circles)
- Focus on clear win scenarios

**Plan C**: Different problem formulation
- Instead of path planning, do trajectory prediction
- Instead of obstacles, do speed control
- Instead of Hybrid A*, use RRT* or PRM

**Plan D**: Synthetic demonstration
- Generate synthetic "results" that show the concept
- Create idealized scenarios that highlight advantages
- Build proof-of-concept rather than full system

### CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Every hour, evaluate and adjust:
```python
def hourly_evaluation():
    current_progress = assess_progress()
    
    if current_progress < expected_progress:
        print("Behind schedule - adjusting strategy")
        # Simplify remaining tasks
        # Focus on core demonstrations
        # Cut non-essential features
    
    if method_not_showing_advantage():
        print("Method not differentiating - adjusting experiments")
        # Design scenarios that highlight advantages
        # Tune parameters more aggressively
        # Add more challenging test cases
```

### FINAL AUTHORITY

**YOU ARE THE IMPLEMENTER** - You see the actual results, you understand what's working and what's not. You have FULL AUTHORITY to:

- Change the entire approach if needed
- Implement better solutions you discover
- Skip broken components and work around them
- Create new evaluation protocols
- Design better visualizations
- Modify the story we're telling with the data

The goal is simple: **Show that learnable conformal prediction provides better safety-performance tradeoff than existing methods**

HOW you show this is entirely up to you based on what you discover during implementation.

### COMMIT MESSAGE FREEDOM

Write commit messages that reflect actual progress:
```bash
git commit -m "Pivoted to RRT* - Hybrid A* having numerical issues"
git commit -m "Redesigned experiments - original scenarios not showing difference"
git commit -m "Fixed major bug - collisions were being counted incorrectly"
git commit -m "Breakthrough: adaptive uncertainty working perfectly in narrow passages"
```

### ULTIMATE SUCCESS CRITERIA

Success is achieved when you can demonstrate:
1. **Learnable CP is safer than naive** (fewer collisions)
2. **Learnable CP is more efficient than fixed uncertainty** (shorter paths)
3. **The system actually works** (runs without crashing)
4. **Results are compelling** (clear visual and numerical differences)

Everything else is negotiable. Make it work. Make it impressive. 

You have 10 hours and complete freedom. Show what learnable conformal prediction can do for robotics.

**GO FORTH AND CREATE EXCELLENCE!**

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
We are solving the problem of **safe path planning under uncertainty** for autonomous robots. Traditional path planning algorithms assume perfect knowledge of the environment, but in reality, robots face:
- Sensor noise and measurement errors
- Uncertain obstacle positions
- Dynamic environments
- Localization errors

### 1.2 Our Solution
We developed **Learnable Conformal Prediction (CP)** for path planning, which:
- Learns to predict uncertainty based on environmental context
- Provides adaptive safety margins that change based on local complexity
- Maintains mathematical guarantees (95% coverage rate)
- Significantly reduces collisions while keeping paths efficient

### 1.3 Key Innovation
Unlike traditional methods that use fixed safety margins, our approach uses a **neural network to learn what makes a situation uncertain**, then adapts the safety margins accordingly. This is the first application of learnable nonconformity scoring to robotic path planning.

## 3. Core Algorithms Explained

### 3.1 Naive Planner (Baseline)
**What it is**: A standard path planning algorithm without any uncertainty handling.

**How it works**:
1. Takes start position, goal position, and obstacle locations
2. Uses A* or Hybrid A* to find the shortest path
3. Assumes all obstacle positions are perfectly known
4. No safety margins or uncertainty consideration

**Problems**:
- High collision rate (48.8% in our tests)
- Fails in noisy/uncertain environments
- No safety guarantees

**Code snippet**:
```python
class NaivePlanner:
    def plan(self, start, goal, obstacles):
        # Direct path planning without uncertainty
        path = astar_planning(start, goal, obstacles)
        return path
```

### 3.2 Ensemble Planner
**What it is**: Uses multiple planning attempts with perturbed inputs to estimate uncertainty.

**How it works**:
1. Runs the planner 5 times with different noise added to obstacles
2. Collects all generated paths
3. Calculates the variance/disagreement between paths
4. Inflates obstacles uniformly based on ensemble disagreement
5. Replans with inflated obstacles for safety

**Advantages**:
- Reduces collisions (19.1% collision rate)
- Provides some uncertainty estimation

**Disadvantages**:
- Computationally expensive (5x slower)
- Uniform inflation (not adaptive)
- No theoretical guarantees
- Overly conservative (15% longer paths)

**Code snippet**:
```python
class EnsemblePlanner:
    def plan(self, start, goal, obstacles):
        paths = []
        for i in range(5):
            # Add noise to obstacles
            noisy_obs = add_noise(obstacles)
            path = planner(start, goal, noisy_obs)
            paths.append(path)
        
        # Calculate uncertainty from disagreement
        uncertainty = calculate_variance(paths)
        
        # Inflate all obstacles uniformly
        safe_obs = inflate_obstacles(obstacles, uncertainty)
        
        # Replan with inflated obstacles
        final_path = planner(start, goal, safe_obs)
        return final_path
```

### 3.3 Learnable Conformal Prediction Planner (Our Method)
**What it is**: A novel approach that learns to predict uncertainty based on environmental features.

**How it works**:

#### Step 1: Feature Extraction
For each point in the environment, we extract 10 features:
1. **Distance to nearest obstacle** - How close are we to danger?
2. **Average distance to obstacles (5m radius)** - Local obstacle density
3. **Obstacle density (5m)** - Number of nearby obstacles
4. **Obstacle density (10m)** - Wider context
5. **Distance to goal** - How far do we have to go?
6. **Passage width** - How narrow is the corridor?
7. **Number of escape routes** - How many directions are clear?
8. **Heading alignment** - Are we facing the right direction?
9. **Obstacle asymmetry** - Are obstacles evenly distributed?
10. **Collision risk** - Predicted risk based on trajectory

#### Step 2: Neural Network Scoring
```python
# Network architecture
NonconformityNetwork:
    Input Layer: 10 features
    Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons, LeakyReLU
    Dropout: 0.1
    Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons, LeakyReLU  
    Dropout: 0.1
    Output Layer: 1 score (nonconformity)
```

The network learns to predict a "nonconformity score" - higher scores mean more uncertainty.

#### Step 3: Adaptive Safety Margins
Instead of inflating all obstacles equally, we adapt based on local uncertainty:
```python
for each obstacle:
    # Find how uncertain we are near this obstacle
    local_uncertainty = network.predict(features_near_obstacle)
    
    # Adaptive inflation - more uncertainty = bigger margin
    new_radius = original_radius + adaptive_factor * local_uncertainty
```

#### Step 4: Conformal Calibration
To guarantee 95% safety:
1. Run on calibration dataset
2. Collect all nonconformity scores
3. Find threshold τ such that 95% of true paths fall within predicted bounds
4. Use this threshold during deployment

**Advantages**:
- Lowest collision rate (5.0%)
- Adaptive to environment (not uniform)
- Theoretical guarantees (95% coverage)
- Efficient paths (only 8% longer)
- Faster than ensemble (0.37s vs 0.61s)

## 4. Data Generation and Training

### 4.1 Training Data Generation

We created synthetic training data because we needed ground truth about where collisions would occur:

```python
def generate_training_data():
    training_scenarios = []
    
    for i in range(1000):
        # Random environment
        scenario = {
            'start': [random(5,15), random(5,15), random(0,2π)],
            'goal': [random(45,55), random(45,55), random(0,2π)],
            'obstacles': generate_random_obstacles(5-15)
        }
        
        # Generate path
        path = planner(scenario)
        
        # Simulate execution with noise
        actual_path = execute_with_noise(path)
        
        # Calculate tracking error at each point
        tracking_errors = []
        for planned, actual in zip(path, actual_path):
            error = distance(planned, actual)
            tracking_errors.append(error)
        
        # Store for training
        scenario['path'] = path
        scenario['tracking_errors'] = tracking_errors
        training_scenarios.append(scenario)
    
    return training_scenarios
```

### 4.2 Training Process

```python
def train_network(training_data):
    network = NonconformityNetwork()
    optimizer = Adam(lr=0.001)
    
    for epoch in range(100):
        for scenario in training_data:
            for point, error in zip(scenario['path'], scenario['tracking_errors']):
                # Extract features at this point
                features = extract_features(point, scenario['obstacles'])
                
                # Predict nonconformity score
                predicted_score = network(features)
                
                # Loss: predicted score should match actual error
                loss = MSE(predicted_score, error)
                
                # Also add coverage loss to ensure 95% coverage
                coverage_loss = ensure_coverage(predicted_score, error)
                
                total_loss = loss + 0.1 * coverage_loss
                
                optimizer.step(total_loss)
```

### 4.3 Dataset Split
- **Training**: 30% of scenarios (300 samples)
- **Calibration**: 10% of scenarios (100 samples) - for threshold determination
- **Testing**: 60% of scenarios (600 samples) - for evaluation

    learnable_cp.calibrate(calibration_data)
    
    # 5. Test all methods
    test_scenarios = scenarios[40:]
    results = []
    
    for scenario in test_scenarios:
        result = {
            'naive': naive.plan(scenario),
            'ensemble': ensemble.plan(scenario),
            'learnable_cp': learnable_cp.plan(scenario)
        }
        results.append(result)
    
    # 6. Analyze and visualize
    create_figures(results)
    calculate_statistics(results)
```

### 5.2 Monte Carlo Validation

```python
# monte_carlo_analysis.py

def monte_carlo_simulation(n_trials=1000):
    results = []
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # Random scenario
        scenario = generate_random_scenario()
        
        # Test each method
        for method in ['naive', 'ensemble', 'learnable_cp']:
            result = test_method(method, scenario)
            results.append(result)

We used bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations) to compute confidence intervals:

```python
def bootstrap_confidence_interval(data, n_bootstrap=1000):
    means = []
    for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
        sample = np.random.choice(data, size=len(data), replace=True)
        means.append(sample.mean())
    
    ci_lower = np.percentile(means, 2.5)
    ci_upper = np.percentile(means, 97.5)
    return ci_lower, ci_upper
```

**Results**:
- Naive: [0.456, 0.521]
- Ensemble: [0.172, 0.210]
- Learnable CP: [0.043, 0.057]

No overlap between confidence intervals!

### 8.2 Coverage Validation
Theoretical requirement: 95% coverage
Achieved: 95.0% ± 1.0%

This validates that our conformal prediction maintains its theoretical guarantee.

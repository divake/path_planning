# Learnable Conformal Prediction for Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Path Planning

## Abstract

We present a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in path planning using learnable conformal prediction (CP). Unlike traditional methods that use fixed uncertainty margins or ensemble-based approaches with uniform inflation, our method learns to adaptively quantify uncertainty based on environmental context. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations (n=1000), we demonstrate that learnable CP reduces collision rates by 89.8% compared to naive planning while maintaining path efficiency (only 8% longer paths vs 15% for ensemble methods). Our approach achieves the theoretical 95% coverage guarantee while showing strong adaptivity (score: 0.79) to varying environmental complexity. Statistical analysis confirms significance (p < 1e-123, Cohen's d = 1.135), making this the first work to successfully apply learnable nonconformity scoring to robotic path planning with formal coverage guarantees.

## 1. Introduction

Safe navigation in uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While traditional path planning algorithms excel in known environments, real-world deployment requires handling various sources of uncertainty: sensor noise, dynamic obstacles, localization errors, and model mismatch. Current approaches typically address this through conservative fixed margins or computationally expensive ensemble methods that lack theoretical guarantees.

Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification with coverage guarantees. However, standard CP methods use fixed nonconformity scores that don't adapt to local environmental context. We propose learnable conformal prediction for path planning, where a neural network learns to predict context-aware nonconformity scores, enabling adaptive safety margins that respond to environmental complexity.

Our key contributions:
1. First application of learnable nonconformity scoring to path planning
2. Adaptive uncertainty quantification that maintains coverage guarantees
3. Comprehensive evaluation showing 89.8% collision reduction vs baselines
4. Open-source implementation demonstrating practical deployment

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Uncertainty in Path Planning
Classical approaches include probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) [1], rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT*) [2], and chance-constrained optimization [3]. These methods typically use fixed uncertainty models that don't adapt to environmental context.

### 2.2 Ensemble Methods
Ensemble planning [4,5] runs multiple planners with perturbed inputs to estimate uncertainty. While effective, these approaches lack theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency scales poorly with ensemble size.

### 2.3 Conformal Prediction
CP provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification with coverage guarantees [6]. Recent work on learnable scoring functions [7] shows promise for adaptive uncertainty, but hasn't been applied to continuous path planning problems.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Given start state $s_0 = (x_0, y_0, \theta_0)$, goal $s_g = (x_g, y_g, \theta_g)$, and obstacles $\mathcal{O} = \{o_i\}$, find path $\pi = \{s_1, ..., s_n\}$ that minimizes cost while maintaining safety with probability $\geq 1-\alpha$.

### 3.2 Learnable Nonconformity Scoring

We learn a neural network $f_\theta: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ that maps environmental features to nonconformity scores:

$$\alpha_i = f_\theta(\phi(s_i, \mathcal{O}, s_g))$$

where $\phi$ extracts features:
- Obstacle density: $d_{obs}(s_i) = |\{o \in \mathcal{O} : ||s_i - o|| < r\}|$
- Passage width: $w(s_i) = \min_{o \in \mathcal{O}} ||s_i - o||$
- Goal distance: $d_g(s_i) = ||s_i - s_g||$
- Local complexity: $c(s_i)$ based on obstacle configuration

### 3.3 Adaptive Safety Margins

For each obstacle $o_j$, we compute adaptive inflation:

$$r'_j = r_j + \beta \cdot \max_{s_i \in \pi} \alpha_i \cdot \mathbb{1}[||s_i - o_j|| < \tau]$$

where $\beta$ is calibrated to achieve $(1-\alpha)$ coverage.

### 3.4 Training Procedure

1. **Data Collection**: Generate paths with ground truth tracking errors
2. **Feature Extraction**: Compute $\phi(s_i, \mathcal{O}, s_g)$ for each state
3. **Network Training**: Minimize combined loss:
   $$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{MSE} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{coverage} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{size}$$
4. **Calibration**: Determine threshold $\tau$ on held-out data

### 3.5 Coverage Guarantee

By conformal prediction theory, our method guarantees:
$$P(s_{true} \in \mathcal{C}(s_{pred})) \geq 1 - \alpha$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the prediction set constructed using learned scores.

| **Learnable CP** | **0.050 ± 0.218** | **95.0%** | **67.9 ± 6.1** | **0.950 ± 0.010** |

**Statistical Significance:**
- Naive vs CP: t(1998) = 25.387, p < 1e-123, d = 1.135
- Ensemble vs CP: t(1998) = 9.915, p < 1e-22, d = 0.443

### 4.3 Adaptivity Analysis

Learnable CP shows strong environmental adaptation:

| Environment | Adaptivity Score | Avg Uncertainty |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Sparse | 0.42 ± 0.15 | 0.31 ± 0.08 |
| Moderate | 0.68 ± 0.22 | 0.52 ± 0.12 |
| Dense | 0.91 ± 0.28 | 0.74 ± 0.15 |
| Narrow | 1.23 ± 0.31 | 0.89 ± 0.18 |

The adaptivity score increases with environmental complexity, demonstrating context-aware uncertainty quantification.

### 4.4 Coverage Analysis

Coverage rate distribution (n=1000):
- Mean: 0.950
- Std: 0.010
- 95% CI: [0.932, 0.968]

The method maintains the theoretical 95% coverage guarantee across all scenarios.

### 4.5 Computational Efficiency

| Naive | 0.123 ± 0.041 | 12 |
| Ensemble | 0.612 ± 0.108 | 85 |
| Learnable CP | 0.368 ± 0.076 | 28 |

Learnable CP is 40% faster than ensemble while achieving better safety.
